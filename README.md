# Tic-Tac-Taco
A revolutionary state-of-the-art mod of the all-time classic 'Tic-Tac-Toe'.

# Design approach
An initial flowchart outlining the high-level stages of the game's creation was prepared (see https://whimsical.com/flowchart-Gj1So9bUuhg3bgt16p6GsM)
The design approach followed in the creation of this game was to initially build a minimum viable product (MVP) and then incrementally introduce new features. 
The MVP was scoped to allow the player to start a game, complete it, and then play again continually if they choose to.
Following completion of the MVP, page styling and player customisation were introduced, which allowed the players to select an avatar and a token of their choice, as well as deciding on the turn duration.
The JS code was then advanced to handle the user's inputs whilst also interacting with the relevant HTML tags and CSS styles to display the desired effects.
Finally, the game's CSS was updated to allow for responsiveness on smaller displays.
